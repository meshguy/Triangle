If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to accomplish real work,
I would like very much to hear from you.  A short letter or email (to
jrs@cs.berkeley.edu) describing how you use Triangle will mean a lot to me.
The more people I know are using this program, the more easily I can
justify spending time on improvements and on the three-dimensional
successor to Triangle, which in turn will benefit you.  Also, I can put you
on a list to receive email whenever a new version of Triangle is available.

If you use a mesh generated by Triangle or plotted by Show Me in a
publication, please include an acknowledgment as well.  And please spell
Triangle with a capital `T'!  If you want to include a citation, use

Generator and Delaunay Triangulator,'' in Applied Computational Geometry:
